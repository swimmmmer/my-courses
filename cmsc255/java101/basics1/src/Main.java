// Class Declaration: basic syntax for declaring a class
public class Main {  // Class members (fields, methods, etc.) go here
    // Main Method:
    public static void main(String[] args) { // Code to be executed goes here
        // Data Types: Java has a variety of data types for integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more.
        // For example, int, double, char, etc.

        // Variables: Variables are declared with a specific data type.
        // To declare and initialize a variable:
        int myVariable = 42;

        // Operators: Java supports various operators for arithmetic, comparison, logical operations, and more.
        // For example, +, -, *, /, ==, &&, ||, etc.

        // Control Structures: Java has control structures like if, else, while, for, and switch for flow control in your code.

        // Method Declaration:
        returnType methodName(int parameter1Name, int parameter2Name) {
        // Method body
        }

        // Object-Oriented Programming: Java is an object-oriented programming language, so it uses classes and objects extensively.
        // You can create objects from classes and call methods on them.

        //Inheritance: Java supports class inheritance, allowing you to create new classes based on existing ones.
        // The extends keyword is used for inheritance.

        //Interfaces: You can define interfaces, which are like contracts for classes to implement.
        // They are declared using the interface keyword.

        //Exception Handling: Java provides try, catch, finally, and throw keywords for exception handling to deal with runtime errors.

        //Packages: Java code is organized into packages, and you can import classes from other packages using the import statement.

        //Access Modifiers: Java uses access modifiers like public, private, protected, and default (no modifier)
        // to control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables.

        //Statements and Blocks: Java uses semicolons ; to terminate statements, and code blocks are enclosed in curly braces {}.
